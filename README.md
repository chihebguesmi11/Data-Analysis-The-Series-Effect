## Project Overview

**SeriesImpact Analysis** is an academic project aimed at understanding how television series affect viewers' daily lives.  
The study leverages statistical techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), and Correspondence Analysis (CA) to draw insights from survey data.

Data was collected using a Google Form titled:  
**"The Series Effect: Uncover How Your Favorite Shows Shape Your Life"**

---

## Objectives

- Analyze the emotional and social influence of TV series on viewers.
- Identify patterns in viewers' behavior and perception changes due to series.
- Understand relationships between professions and reasons for watching series.

## Tools & Methods

This project was implemented in **R**, using the following methods:

- ðŸ“‰ **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):**  
  - Dimension reduction on rating-based questions about moods and relationships.  
  - Interpretation of viewer profiles based on series genre preferences.

- ðŸŽ¯ **MCA (Multiple Correspondence Analysis):**  
  - Analysis of binary variables (e.g., "Did you cry watching a series?").

- ðŸ”„ **CA (Correspondence Analysis):**  
  - Cross-analysis between profession and motivation for watching series.

###  R Packages

- `tidyverse`
- `FactoMineR`
- `factoextra`
- `knitr`

##  Key Findings

### PCA: Series & Mood

- **Dimension 1:** Associated with comedy and social series (Friends, HIMYM, TBBT).
- **Dimension 2:** Linked to intense, dramatic series (Dark, Bridgerton, Game of Thrones).
- Viewers tend to cluster by the emotional tone of their preferred shows.

### PCA: Series & Relationships

- **Dimension 1:** Reflects introspection (Breaking Bad, Lost, Suits).
- **Dimension 2:** Captures how viewers perceive family, love, and friendship through series (Friends, HIMYM).

###  MCA: Viewer Behavior

- Binary responses show distinct behavioral patterns.
- The "No" cluster appears more homogeneous, while the "Yes" cluster is more diverse in behavior.

### CA: Profession vs. Motivation

- Visual representation of how students, workers, and others align with specific motivations (relaxation, curiosity, plot quality).
- Detectable trends link social role to media consumption reasons.
